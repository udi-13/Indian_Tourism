      <h2>For singles</h2>
      <p>
        There are some things in life that you must do on your own, all by yourself and at least once. Solo Travel is gaining popularity among the travel community steadily due to the sheer spontaneity that comes with it. The quest to discover oneself along with spiritual rejuvenation and flow of adventurous adrenaline becomes a perfect reason to pack your travel bag and climb those serene mountains or stroll by silent beaches, all by yourself. Solo travel also allows you to not be enslaved by <br>the whims and fancies of your fellow travellers, and your planning is largely unmarred by group dynamics. So if you want to trek up that hill on your next trip to the Himalayas, or watch the sunrise by the beach on your next trip to Gokarna, get ready to go! You get a sense of independence and freedom, from being out of your comfort zone

      <h2>For couples</h2>
      <p>
        Unmarried couples may be forced into separate rooms or given tips on where to catch a quick moment together. Be aware you may be vulnerable to stigma. Whereas the country, which ties love up into a neat little box, will heartily embrace married couples. But there are also many beautiful sights for you to plan a romantic getaway to India.

        <br>It’s very complex and the general rule, especially when it comes to PDA, is to be sensitive to the atmosphere around you. It’s a country with endless opportunities to showcase your love and discover each other, as long as you do your research right. When you’re out, watch how other people, and other couples in particular, are behaving and simply follow suit. You may even learn a thing or two on clandestine loving from our attention-weary youth!
