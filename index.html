           We enjoyed every day of our trip: the selection of hotels, restaurants and places to visit allowed us to get a real taste of every city we visited.<br> <b>INDIAN TOURISM</b> Tour is the best travel agency I have ever met untill now. I have been travel different times and I have never met an agency so helpful and near my needs. We visited New Delhi, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Jaipur, Agra and Varanasi.The transportation were also perfectly organized.

          I would like to mention that this was our first visit to India and we were unsure on whether or not to get a tour since we are used to travelling by ourselves. However, looking back, we strongly believe that we couldn't have seen and experienced as much of the country as we did without their services.<br>We are glad we chose <b>INDIAN TOURISM</b> and we would strongly recommend them to any family members.
